In my early days of using [Freeway](http://softpress.com/products/freeway-pro.html), I had lots of questions, which meant I spent the majority of my time searching for answers. Answer-hunting was not very easy, as Freeway's documentation is spread across the web in small bits and pieces.  
  
You have the "official" documentation in the [Using Freeway](http://download.softpress.com/downloads/Using_FW_2012.pdf) and [Freeway Reference](http://download.softpress.com/downloads/FW5_Reference_Rev004_screenversion.pdf) guides but this required opening the PDF's and searching, which was FAR too much work for my taste. Of course, you could just Google it! However, this too did not work well either. (Imagine the results for "Freeway Rollover"!). Then, you have the wonderful [Freewaytalk](http://freewaytalk.net/) which, sadly, lacks a good search feature, as you get flooded in the results with tons of re: to each thread. In addition, there are lots of other tidbits of information scattered across the webosphere.  
  
Then, I had an idea…  
  
Build a custom search engine that only searches Freeway-relevant sites! Hence, [FreewaySearch](http://freewaysearch.calebgrove.com/) was born!

Simply click [here](alfred://customsearch/FreewaySearch/fs/utf8/noplus/http://www.google.com/cse?q=blah&submit=Freeway+Search&cx=002987801838384446422%3Av7fs4hh8mye#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q={query}&gsc.page=1) to add it to Alfred, then use the `fs` keyword to run the search. :)</p>
