Greetings and salutations! You have found the online abode of eccentric Caleb Grove, amalgamation of hipster, redneck, geek, cowboy, and wannabe programmer. He is also an entrepreneur and runs [OnRamp Web Design](http://onrampwebdesign.com). Strange mix, I know.
	
His history is just as strange. He grew up in the middle of 11 other siblings, was homeschooled for his entire existence, and spent a disproportionate amount of his childhood on cattle ranches in central Montana. He built his first website at the ripe old age of 16 using iWeb.
	
He loves Christ, his siblings and parents, typography, coffee, history, learning, and speaking of himself in third-person.

You can find him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SirCalebGrove) and <a href="https://plus.google.com/104352152447941147453/about" rel="author">Google+</a>.

## The Site
This site was written by Caleb in [Coda](http://www.panic.com/coda/), [Chocolat](https://chocolatapp.com), and [TextMate 2](http://macromates.com) (he can't pick one) using the venerable [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build it (it's awesome), with additional cools provided by [highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com). Honorable mentions to an [awesome playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/123118516/playlist/1rlz2piAH9GpkTVeCfSafo), [Anvil](http://anvilformac.com), [Forklift](http://binarynights.com/forklift/) and all the slick folks at [Freewaytalk.net](http://freewaytalk.net).
